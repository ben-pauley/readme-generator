# README Generator

## My Repository

In this GitHub repository, you will find my completed README Generator. My task was to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using Node.js and the Inquirer package and to demonstrate how to use the application. I believe I was successful in meeting the required criteria.

## Installation

To install this project, you may either clone this repository to a local directory, or fork the repository to your own GitHub. After having installed Node.js, you must then install the inquirer module using `node install` in the command line. Then you will be able to run the application by typing `node index.js`, and then follow the inline instructions. [This video]() demonstrates exactly how to do all of this.

## Software Used

This project was completed using Visual Studio Code, the command line, Node.js and the Inquirer package.

## Conclusion

Overall, I found the creation of this application to be a nice introduction to Back End development and it has me very excited to learn more and create more command line applications.
